# Shareable Renovate Config

This is a set of [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) configurations that can be extended. To use, take advantage
of the [shareable config presets](https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-presets/) feature! Simply add
`github>marinatedconcrete/config//renovate/default` to your `extends` list. You can even tag it with an appropriate
version if you would like by added `#renovate-config-{version}` to the end, such that version `1.0.0` would look like
`github>marinatedconcrete/config//renovate/default#renovate-config-1.0.0`.

[Here is a full list of GitHub releases](https://github.com/marinatedconcrete/config/releases?q=%22renovate-config%22).
